General architecture of the application:
- MVVM Architecture Pattern

Technical choices:
- Database - Room
- DI - Dagger Hilt
- Paging 
- Coroutine + Flow
- Live Data
- Design - Mateial 3 
- API - Retrofit
- Image - Glide
- ViewBinding + DataBinding
- Navigation
- Menu Provider
- Support Different Screens - Smallest Width
- SVG Icons
- Kotlin Extensions

What I missed ? 
I tried my best to include all the features inside the app. but there are a few of implementation to make some feature to be working correctly like :
- Error Handling of Paging
- Generate the different dimens of texts size, padding, margin, height and width for all the screen sizes inside the match dimens file.
- Clean Code to make the code more effeciant.
- Bref Documentation for each peace of code in the app.
- Replace LiveData with State & Shared Flow.

It is a wonderful opportunity to work with you, but I apologize for not working all the features due to work pressure,
I wanted to show you the way I work and think about implementation for Android apps.
